  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about">
    <img src="about.jpg" alt="My Photo" class="img">
    <p>Hello! I'm Sandip, currently living in the beautiful city of Kyoto, Japan. 
    I am pursuing my master's degree in IT with a major concentration in web development at KCGI. 
    I moved to Japan two years ago, and it has been an incredible journey so far.<br><br>

    My passion is traveling the world and immersing myself in diverse cultures. 
    In addition to my native Nepali, I am fluent in Hindi, English, and Japanese. 
    Although I might seem reserved at first, you'll find that 
    I am a completely different person once we become close friends.<br><br>

    Living in Japan as an international student is undoubtedly challenging.
    Mastering the Japanese language is essential, but it's equally important
    to embrace the rich culture and traditions of this fascinating country.<br><br>

    To all my fellow students and friends, I say: "Ganbatte kudasai!" (Do your best!)</p>
